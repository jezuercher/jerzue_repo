## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) #clearing all variables etc.
samples = rlnorm(100, 1, 0.25) #drawing 100 samples form a random distribution
hist.samples = hist(samples, plot=F) #create a hist diagramm without plotting it, in order to get the counts
hist.samples$counts = log(hist.samples$counts,2) #converte the counts to log scale
```
### Variance and standard deviation
The variance of the random set of samples was found to be `r var(samples)`.

The standard deviation was found to be `r sd(samples)`.


## Plots


```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(samples)
plot(hist.samples, main = "Histogram on log scale")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
